# PowerShell


These are various personal projects that were born from my desire to learn PowerShell.


Each subfolder will contain a more detailed explanation of what each project is.


### Personal Aliases


I first began by creating a series of aliases and functions to let me use the terminal how I wanted.


These aliases and functions are in Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1


### Backup Script


I bought an external SSD, so I wrote a script that would automate the process of backuping up files.


### Start-Job


As I was working on my backup script, I ran into the need to use Start-Job.


I explored several different ways to pass data to Start-Job.
